1. Introduction
Recipee is a recipe website developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to discover, share, and review recipes. The platform consists of four modules: Admin, Chef, Food Critic, and User. Chefs and Food Critics require approval from the Admin before they can contribute to the website. The goal of Recipee is to provide a platform for users to explore a wide variety of recipes, engage with chefs, and receive feedback from food critics.

2. Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to develop Recipee:

Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
HTML/CSS: Markup language for structuring web pages and styling.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
Backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
Express.js: A web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document database for storing data.
Additional Tools:

Mongoose: An object modeling tool for MongoDB.
Axios: A library for making HTTP requests from Node.js and the browser.



3. System Architecture
Recipee follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend and backend are decoupled. The frontend handles user interactions and rendering the user interface, while the backend manages data storage, business logic, and API endpoints.

The frontend is built using React.js and communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to the RESTful API endpoints provided by the Express.js server. The server interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

4. Modules

4.1 Admin Module
The Admin module is responsible for managing the Recipee platform. It provides the following features:

Approve or reject chef and food critic applications.
Manage user accounts and roles.
Add, update, and delete recipes and categories.
Moderate user-generated content, such as comments and reviews.
Generate reports and statistics about platform usage.


4.2 Chef Module
The Chef module allows registered chefs to contribute their own recipes to the Recipee platform. It offers the following features:

Submit recipe applications to become an approved chef.
Create and manage recipes, including adding ingredients, steps, and images.
Edit and update existing recipes.
Receive feedback and comments from users and food critics.
Track recipe popularity and ratings.


4.3 Food Critic Module
The Food Critic module enables registered food critics to review and rate recipes on the Recipee platform. It provides the following features:

Submit applications to become an approved food critic.
Rate and review recipes based on taste, presentation, and creativity.
Comment on recipes to provide additional feedback.
View and track recipe ratings and reviews from other food critics.
Collaborate with chefs to enhance recipe quality.


4.4 User Module
The User module caters to general users who visit the Recipee platform. It offers the following features:

Browse and search for recipes by category, cuisine, or ingredient.
View recipe details, including ingredients, steps, and images.
Leave comments and reviews on recipes.
Save favorite recipes for future reference.
Interact with chefs and food critics through comments and feedback.


5. Installation
To install and run the Recipee project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system, if not already installed.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
Install backend dependencies by running the command: npm install.
Install frontend dependencies by navigating to the client directory and running npm install.
Create a .env file in the project root directory and configure the necessary environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection URL, API keys, etc.).
Start the backend server by running npm start in the project root directory.
Start the frontend development server by navigating to the client directory and running npm start.
Access the website in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

6. Usage
Once the Recipee project is installed and running, users can access the website and interact with the different modules based on their role. Here are some common usage scenarios:

Admins: Administrators have access to the admin module, where they can manage user accounts, approve or reject chef and food critic applications, moderate user-generated content, and manage recipes and categories.

Chefs: Registered chefs can apply to become approved chefs and contribute their own recipes. They can create, update, and manage recipes, receive feedback from users and food critics, and engage with the community.

Food Critics: Registered food critics can apply to become approved critics and review and rate recipes. They can provide ratings, reviews, and comments on recipes, collaborate with chefs to enhance recipe quality, and interact with other food critics.

Users: General users can browse and search for recipes, view recipe details, leave comments and reviews, save favorite recipes, and engage with chefs and food critics through comments and feedback.

Users can navigate the website using the provided user interface and interact with the different modules according to their role and preferences.

7. Conclusion
